## Inspiration

This is a React.js project that was originally supposed to be written using JQuery but I soon realized that the mountains of code was starting to become very cumbersome!! After 2 weeks of hard work put into the project, I had made the ultimate decision to begin my React.js Journey by rewriting my initial code in React and seeing this project to completion. After almost 7 months of blood, sweat, tears, and maybe some dented desks (sorry desk... :\ ), I am very proud to announce the 1st iteration of my Application/Extension!
