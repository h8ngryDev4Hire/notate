## Inspiration

This is a React.js project that was originally supposed to be written using JQuery but I soon realized that the mountains of code was starting to become very cumbersome!! After 2 weeks of hard work put into the project, I had made the ultimate decision to begin my React.js Journey by rewriting my initial code in React and seeing this project to completion. This project has no other dependencies besides the required ones such as react, tailwindcss, webpack, etc. After almost 7 months of blood, sweat, tears, and maybe some dented desks (sorry desk... :\ ), I am very proud to announce the 1st iteration of my Application/Extension!

## Browser Support

This project was written originally for Chromium-based Web Browsers, but also has active development for Gecko-based (Firefox) Browsers. Please review our [HELP-WANTED.md](https://github.com/h8ngryDev4Hire/notate/blob/main/HELP-WANTED.md) for Firefox's current development status.
